TODO:

* rename the peer* classes to not clash with libp2p's terminology of peerInfo, etc
* rename the project to be js-libp2p-go-http or something
* sort the URI scheme to be used
* implement headers
* make bodies stream
* run it in a service worker that intercepts HTTP hits from the main client, and sends them via libp2p to another peer rather than to a server.
