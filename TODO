TODO:

* implement headers
* make bodies stream
* check we close our streams properly and generally handle memleaks
* run it in a service worker that intercepts HTTP hits from the main client, and sends them via libp2p to another peer rather than to a server.
* turn the test jig into proper unit tests (both for go<->js loopback and then js<->js loopback)
